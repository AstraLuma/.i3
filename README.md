.i3
===
My [i3](http://i3wm.org/) configuration and scripts. My goal is to build up a fully-featured desktop environment based on i3.

* Screen locking for security
* Power management
* Basic desktop daemons: PulseAudio, NetworkManager, Bluetooth, Dropbox
* Wallpaper (from dropbox)

Requirements
------------
Most of these can be had from your package manager.

* i3 (obviously)
* [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python) (currently from git)
* ImageMagick
* `feh`
* `scrot`
* `xautolock`
* `xset`
* `gpg-agent`
* [`pass`](http://www.passwordstore.org/)
* `xdotool`
